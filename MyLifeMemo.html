      <div class="title">My Life</div>

      <div class="cat">Childhood</div>
      <div class="body">My family was quite at the lower-middle income family so the income was a bit on the low side but we were content with our life back then. We got enough food, enough supplies, and we weren't materialistic so our needs were little.</div>

      <div class="cat">Teenager Life</div>
      <img src="./picture/teen.JPG" alt="pic">
      <img src="./picture/canada.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="body">I was also a quiet kid in my teenager days. Even though I didn't focus fully in school, I always managed to stay in th top 8 of the class. I surprisingly had quite a lot of friends even though I was an introvert. I didn't know what I wanted to do either so I usually just spent my time on mobile game. I went to finish my 2 years of high school in Canada and I can say that it was quite a challanging two years of my life since I have to be responsible for everything and be independent at the same timea all on my own</div>

      <div class="cat">Adult Life</div>
      <div class="body">Entering adulthood, I had to quit quite a lot of games and find a career of my own. I was always around technology even when I was a kid so I tried teaching myself web development and somehow managed to be in the development field. I currently go to a university while working to make my own spending.</div>

      <div class="cat">Future Goals</div>
      <div class="body">Tech is a huge world so I'm looking to boarden my vision in the field but firstly is to become a full-stacked web developer before I graduate</div>
